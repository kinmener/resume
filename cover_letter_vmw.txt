To whom it may concern, 

I am interested in the system engineering intern position. I have much related 
experience and capabilities. I would appreciate your consideration for this job 
opening.

I am interested in the concurrent programming and the distributed systems.
Thus, I took some relative courses, such as multicore computing, software 
multicore processor, distributed computing, and distributed systems. Also, I am 
a co-author for the paper(PLDI'13) about developing a Java extension 
programming language supporting automatic signaling mechanism for concurrency 
and a co-author for the paper(SOSP'11) about detecting failure in distributed 
systems. In addition, I have extensive programming experience. I severed as an 
intern for Intel to develop a framework for gate-level engineering change order 
in C/C++. I was also a part-time website developer when I was a college 
student. 

I appreciate your taking the time to review my credentials and experience.
Again, thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Wei-Lun Hung
