     \item Relation Determinization
    %Boolean relations are an important tool in system synthesis and verification. They can characterize solutions to a set of Boolean constraints. However, for hardware implement of a system, a deterministic function often has to be extracted from a relation. Prior methods focused on function optimization but were unlikely to handle large problem instances. We focused on scalability with reasonable optimization quality. The results showed that Boolean relations with thousands of variables can be determinized inexpensively using Craig Interpolation. With such extended capacity, we would anticipate real-world applications. Published in the {\it IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD'09)}.

    \item Prepared real state transition relation benchmark circuits

    \end{mybullet}
    
    \item Boolean Function Bi-Decomposition
    %Boolean function bi-decomposition is a fundamental operation in logic synthesis. Finding such decomposition reduces circuit complexity and yields simple physical design solutions. Prior methods may not be able to decompose large functions. We proposed a novel solution to these difficulties using Craig Interpolation and SAT Solving. The experiments showed promising results on the scalability of bi-decomposition. Thereby the capacity of bi-decomposition can be much extended for large functions. Published in the {\it Design Automation Conference (DAC'08)}.
    \begin{mybullet}
    \item Implemented the algorithm of computing Craig Interpolant
    \item Evaluated the scalability of bi-decomposition and the optimality of variable partition

    \end{mybullet}
   
    
    \item Sequential Circuit Verification
    %Retiming and resynthesis are among the most important techniques for practical sequential circuit optimization. However, their applicability is much limited due to verification concerns. To overcome this bottleneck, we studied both the theoretical and practical aspects of inductive verification on the equivalence between circuits under retiming and resynthesis transformation. Through the study of its completeness condition, we extended the verification capability and capacity. Our results overcome part of the verification bottleneck in logic synthesis. Published in the {\it IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD'07)}.
