To whom it may concern, 

I am interested in the summer intern position. I have much related experience
and capabilities. I would appreciate your consideration for this job opening.

I have extensive programming experience. I was a part-time website developer 
when I was a college student. I worked with 3 people to develop and maintain 
systems for National Taiwan University. After I completed my master's degree, 
I severed as IT Officer in Taiwan Coast Guard Administration. There, I led a 
team to design and build the system for officers in duty to manage information. 
I also severed as an intern for Intel to develop a framework for gate-level
engineering change order.

I have attached my resume. I appreciate your taking the time to review my 
credentials and experience.
Again, thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Wei-Lun Hung
