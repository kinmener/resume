To whom it may concern, 

I am interested in the intern-Technical position. I have much related 
experience and capabilities. I would appreciate your consideration for this job 
opening.

I am interested in the distributed systems and the concurrent programming. 
Thus, I took some relative courses, such as distributed computing, distributed 
systems, multicore computing, and software multicore processor. In addition, I 
am also familiar with software engineering. I am the teaching assistant for
software engineering and design laboratory and the design patterns.  
Furthermore, I have extensive programming experience. I severed as an 
intern for Intel to develop a framework for gate-level engineering change order 
in C/C++. I was an IT officer when I fulfilled the mandatory military service.
I led a team to design and develop web service to manage the information of
office in duty. I was also a part-time website developer when I was a college 
student. I designed and implemented a platform for students and companies to
match jobs and requirements.

I appreciate your taking the time to review my credentials and experience.
Again, thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Wei-Lun Hung
